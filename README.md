# Tea Subscription Admin Portal

This project consists of two parts: a **Rails API** backend and a **React** frontend. It is designed to manage subscriptions, associated customers, and teas.

---

## Project Structure

- **Backend (Rails API)**: Handles subscriptions, customers, and teas, and serves the data via API endpoints.
- **Frontend (React)**: Consumes the API and displays subscription data to users with options for filtering, viewing details, and toggling subscription status.
